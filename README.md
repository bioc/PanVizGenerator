# PanVizGenerator

This R package is a companion to the [PanViz](https://github.com/thomasp85/PanViz) javascript visualization for functionally annotated pangenomes. While PanViz is fully self-contained once it is created, this package takes care of converting your pangenome data into a PanViz file.

This package is intended for future inclusion into the Bioconductor project.
