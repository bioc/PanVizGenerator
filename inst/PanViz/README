To see your visualisation open the index.html file in your browser of choice 
(provided it is relatively modern).

All files that comes alongside the index.html file are necessary for the
visualisation to work. Do not remove them and alter them only if you are 100%
sure at what you are doing.

PanViz could not be possible without D3.js, so a huge applause goes out to Mike
Bostock and everyone else related to that project. Furthermore it incoorporate
code from Marcelo Criscuolo (https://github.com/mcrisc/SetJS). Thanks go out to
him as well.
